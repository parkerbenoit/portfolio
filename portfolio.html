    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Parker Benoit and welcome to my portfolio! Although I'm new to programming, I intend to build out this page over the coming months to showcase my work and skillset in the hopes of finding an internship, then a full time job within the tech industry.<span class="italic"> The beginning of my journey has been one filled with much anxiety and self-doubt,</span> but with the right attitude and determination I believe I will succeed in fulfilling my dream of working in tech. Below I've listed some of my interests so you can get to know me a little more personally!</p>

    <ul class="float1">
      <li>Music: DJing, playing piano, vinyl records, attending concerts</li>
      <li>Sports: tennis, basketball, mountain biking, skateboarding</li>
      <li>Video Games: FIFA, Among Us, Call of Duty, Final Fantasy</li>
      <li>Food: I <strong>really</strong> love cooking and going to new restaurants!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My path to programming was unorthodox, <em>as it commonly is</em>. I graduated high school in 2014 and set off to college at Washington State University. I quickly came to realize that this wasn't the place for me and after one semester moved back home to Seattle. After some soul searching I decided to move to Bellingham, WA, where I began attending Whatcom Community College. I completed a year or so of classes while working at a bar to support myself. It was around this time that my drive for school lessened and my passion for music was at an all time high. I decided to take a break from school to work and follow my passion for music. Initially I began working shows at a local venue,which blossomed into me promoting and booking some events focused on techno and house music. This led me to DJing which quickly became an obsession of mine and after some practice I began planning and playing shows around Bellingham and some festivals in the western Washington area during the summer months. After a while though I came to realize that music was more of a passion for me than it was a job, and my drive to persue a career in the music industry began to dwindle. This feeling coupled with the pandemic caused by Covid-19 led me to completely rethink what I was doing with my life and career aspirations. At this time I was working for a clothing manufacturing/distribution company based in Bellingham and had seen the web development and design teams at our company thriving and enjoying their jobs while I felt stuck. In the summer of 2020 I had made my decision to leave Bellingham, move to Seattle, and persue a career in the tech industry. And here we are! I couldn't be happier with my decision and I look forward to learning more everyday.</p>

    <H1>Projects</H1>
    
    <h3>I don't have much to show in terms of my finished projects uploaded to the internet, as most of my days have been spent trying to just get the information from the lessons (I'm so new to HTML that I move somewhat slow) but I will list what I have here:</h3>

    <ol>
      <li> 
        <a href="https://parkerbenoit.github.io/vacation">Vacation</a>
        <p>This page was created as part of a project at Epicodus to practice using Bootstrap and inserting links into a live webpage. This project used HTML and CSS files written in Visual Studio Code, with the assistance of Bootstrap for styles. Although the content is clearly unfinished and somewhat comedic in nature, I believe that it showcases a somewhat clean and responsive website that when browser peramiters are changed, responds accordingly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/parkerbenoit/week-in-review/blob/master/index.html">Week in Review</a>
        <p>This project was something that was one that we were walked through how to correctly use rows and responsive webpages. It is also a great example of well written clean code. This project again was written in VSCode in HTML and CSS for styles with assistance from Bootstrap. This was the first webpage that upon finishing a lesson I truly felt like I was making strides with the concepts being presented.</p>
