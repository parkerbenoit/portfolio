    <h4><strong>About Me</strong></h4>
      <p>My name is Parker Benoit and this is my portfolio. Although I'm new to programming, I intend to build out this page over the coming months to showcase my work and skillset in the hopes of finding an internship, then a full time job within the tech industry. The beginning of my journey has been one filled with much anxiety and self-doubt, but with the right attitude and determination I believe I will succeed in fulfilling my dream of working in tech.</p>
